# SE320 Introduction to Game Development Term Project

**UnderWorld**
Story
Our character finds itself in the UnderWorld. This place is filled with monsters and to go back to its world our character has to fight or bargain with these monsters. The choices someone makes have never been more important. They will decide if going back home will be a piece of cake or a headache! 

When in level one our player first needs to collect some items that have been scattered around. To collect them, the player simply needs to interact with the stuff that is laying around. These items are called “basic items”. When there is no item to collect our player will move on. Then comes the first monster of the level one. Player now has two choices; either fight the monster or bargain with it. If player choses to bargain with the monster it cost 6 Basic Items total, 5 Basic Items converted into a Bargain Item and player has to have 1 Basic Item left. If player choses to fight the monster a game panel appears and player has to win that mini game to defeat the monster. Player cannot move on in the map until that happens. Winning the game also means winning Skill Items. Each monster has different amount of Skill Item.  For each level only one bargain is allowed. And each monster has different Bargain Item levels. The difficulty of the mini games are decided based on the skill level of the player. 

We have three different levels. The map changes with this different levels. The logic is the same though. Just more monsters and more difficult games. Player has to decide and plan careful to win the games and collect as much as points as possible. All of these numbers are changed according to the level and the monster. 


(UnderWorld is inspired by the game Undertale)
